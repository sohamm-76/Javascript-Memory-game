## 🚀 About the Game

1️⃣ **🧠 Memory Challenge**  
The game generates a random sequence of colors that the player must remember  
and repeat in the correct order to move ahead.

2️⃣ **🎯 Progressive Difficulty**  
With every successful round, the level increases and the sequence becomes longer,  
making the game more challenging and engaging.

3️⃣ **✨ Interactive Feedback**  
Smooth color flash animations provide instant visual feedback for both  
game actions and user clicks.

4️⃣ **🏆 High Score Tracking**  
The highest score achieved is saved using **localStorage**,  
so your best performance remains even after refreshing the page.
